    "### Activity 4. Poisson Distribution: Simulating Overdose Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo:** The **Poisson distribution** is useful for modeling counts of rare events over a given time or space, especially when the events occur independently. In behavioral genetics and public health, we might use a Poisson model for something like the number of **opioid overdose events** in a population within a year. The Poisson distribution has a single parameter $\\lambda$ (lambda), which is both the expected value *and* the variance of the distribution. For example, if on average 10 overdoses occur per year in a city, we could model the yearly count of overdoses as $\text{Pois}(\\lambda=10)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s simulate a scenario: suppose the **annual overdose rate** is approximately “$\\mathbf{0.001}$ per person per year” (this would correspond to about 0.1% risk per person per year, or 1 overdose per 1000 people per year – a rate in the range of reported values for opioid overdoses in some populations). If our synthetic sample has about 10,000 individuals, the expected number of overdoses in one year for this group is $\\lambda = 10{,}000 \times 0.001 = 10$. We will simulate the distribution of the number of overdose events in one year across many hypothetical “repetitions” of that year.\n"

    "*Simulated Poisson distribution of yearly opioid overdose counts for a population of 10,000 (assuming an average rate $\\lambda=10$ per year).* The bar heights represent the probability of seeing that many overdose events in a year. The distribution is centered around 10 (the expected value) and has a roughly bell-shaped spread: for example, 8, 9, 10, 11 overdoses are the most likely counts in a year, each with around 10–12% probability. Lower counts like 0, 1, 2 are extremely unlikely (less than 0.1% for 0 events, in this simulation), and very high counts (say 20 or more) are also unlikely. This reflects the Poisson property that the variance equals the mean – there’s considerable year-to-year fluctuation, but it’s relatively rare to deviate by more than a few events from the mean in either direction.\n",

What’s the probability of 0 overdoses now (it will be even smaller)?  \n",

That yields a $\text{Pois}(1)$ distribution, which is much more likely to have 0 events in a year. You can simulate this scenario and observe that $P(X=0)$ might be around 37% when $\\lambda=1$.  \n",
    "\n",

Then inspect the probabilities or plot: see how a larger $\\lambda$ (due to higher rate or more people) makes the Poisson distribution spread out more (and the chance of zero events drops), whereas a smaller $\\lambda$ makes the distribution concentrate more at the lower counts (including a higher chance of zero events).\n",
